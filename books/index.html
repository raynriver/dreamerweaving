    <p>Guide to exploring nature: 
    </p><p>
We start with demonstrating respectful interest for Nature. 
 </p><p>
Then we earn access to information directly from Nature, by asking direct questions, as we explore the information pouring to and through us as communication from Nature.
 </p><p>
As we consistently show up maintaining this growing relationship, we eventually earn access to the experience of the planet's relationship with the rest of the cosmos.
 </p><p>
Once you understand the way natural elements like the wind and animals make sense of communication, you are better able to be a custodian of your own energetic impact on the world within and around you, making you a better custodian of the natural world.
 </p><p>
      By reading this book, you are beginning to send a signal to the natural world that you want to enter into a better relationship.
