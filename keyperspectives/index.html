    <h2> A Key Perspective to Cultivate Here</h2>
  <br>
    <p>
      Our modern societies often compel us to believe that Nature is not alive. But that is an illusion. If humanity is to survive the cataclysms that are occurring, each willing human must begin to consciously reconnect with the living intelligence of the planet we live in.

If you would like to further develop this experience, take greater responsibility for your impact on the world you participate in, and experience a more meaningful life, please open this book and commit to embodying the principles presented therein.
